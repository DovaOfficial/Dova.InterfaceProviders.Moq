# Dova.InterfaceProviders.Moq

Default implementation for IInterfaceObjectProvider, which uses Moq as a base.
Currently this is a working solution.
This might change in the future but for now feel free to use it.
And the thing that might change is how Dova handles creating interface object types.
By that I mean what should be returned from methods and properties of interface types.
